# Uniform Spanning Trees

Notes:
- Right now, uniformspanningtree.py generates a uniform spanning tree via Wilson's algorithm (LERW)
- !!! It would be cool to visualize the loops' generation and erasure (this is currently not displayed) !!!
- `ust.py` is the most updated/clean (cell vertex-based tree generation)
